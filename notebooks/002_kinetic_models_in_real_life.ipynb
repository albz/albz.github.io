    "Instead of giving a formal mathematical definition, we might want to uvail this concept with an example construction. Instead of referring to some epidemiologic model, e.g. a hillness speading, despite pertinet sounds less dramatic and sillier to image how a given gossip can spread from person to person.\n",
    "Intuitively what we are planning to do is rather simple. One person, in a room, knows a gossip and meeting with a colleague share such a piece of gossip. Now te two people moving in room will eventually meet with other two colleagues and the gossip will be shared among four people. And clearly, so on.\n",
    "The room example is intuitive enought and allow for smooth programming without many technicalities, still it misses the most of the model: the gossip being broght outside of the room to a pub, to a different building, to people above some age since the too youngs cannot be interested, and so on.\n",
    "It is rather important that while the kinetic effects are important, we still want to measure some fluid (or aggregated) quantities, such as the total number of people aware of the gossip and\n",
    "the radius of influence of the gossip. How far is the gossip spreading? These models can answer this question."
